# PokÃ©mon Search App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my PokÃ©mon search application that I built for my JavaScript assignment. It's a simple but fun web app that lets you search for any PokÃ©mon using the PokeAPI.

## What it does

- **Search PokÃ©mon**: Type in any PokÃ©mon name (like "pikachu" or "charizard") or their ID number (like "25" or "6")
- **Get Info**: Shows you the PokÃ©mon's image, name, ID, and types
- **Looks Good**: Clean, modern design that works on phones and computers
- **Handles Errors**: If you type something wrong, it'll let you know nicely

## How to use it

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Type a PokÃ©mon name or number in the search box
3. Click "Search" or just press Enter
4. Check out the results!

## What I learned building this

This project helped me practice:
- Working with APIs (the PokeAPI is pretty cool!)
- Using async/await in JavaScript
- Updating the webpage dynamically
- Handling errors gracefully
- Making things look good with CSS

## The tech stuff

- **HTML**: Basic structure
- **CSS**: Styling and making it responsive
- **JavaScript**: All the functionality using vanilla JS (no frameworks!)
- **PokeAPI**: Where I get all the PokÃ©mon data from

## Features I added

- **Type badges**: Each PokÃ©mon type has its own color
- **Loading spinner**: Shows while searching
- **Error messages**: Helpful feedback when things go wrong
- **Mobile friendly**: Works great on phones
- **Enter key support**: You can search by pressing Enter

## Project files

```
pokeApiIntegration/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # The main page
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # All the styling
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # The JavaScript magic
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Some cool things about the code

The app uses modern JavaScript features like:
- `async/await` for API calls
- Template literals for HTML generation
- Arrow functions
- Error handling with try/catch

## Browser support

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Future ideas

If I had more time, I'd love to add:
- Search history
- Favorite PokÃ©mon list
- More stats and info
- Evolution chains
- Shiny PokÃ©mon sprites

## Getting started

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start searching for PokÃ©mon!

That's it! No complicated setup needed - it's just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About this project

This was built as part of my coding assignment to learn about JavaScript objects, DOM manipulation, and working with APIs. The PokeAPI is free to use and has tons of great data about PokÃ©mon!

Feel free to use this code for learning or as a starting point for your own projects. Happy coding! ðŸŽ®
